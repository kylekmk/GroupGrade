## What is GroupGrade?
Group grade is a Chrome Extension which was created to make group project grading in Canvas more efficient. GroupGrade was created out of a need to automate the grading process. As a grader I found I wasted most of my time repeatedly copy and pasting criteria into each group member's rubric, so I decided to create a solution. This allows the grader to fill in the Chrome extension with grades and comments on their custom rubric and autofill each student's rubric with one click.

## Creating a Rubric
To create a rubric click the add button on both the main menu and the settings menu. Customize your rubric by specifying the amount of criteria and value for each criteria. If you want to change your rubric or remove it, simply edit or delete it!

## Rubric Selection
Select your rubric by clicking it on the settings screen!

## Filling in the Rubric
Fill in comment and grade values and click "autofill" while the Canvas Speed Grader is open to grade a student project!

## Autofill Grades
Once grades are autofilled, you can read them one last time before you submit. For privacy reasons I cannot show a student's rubric being filled out.
